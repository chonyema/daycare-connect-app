# ✅ "Parent Not Found" Error - FIXED!

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified
The "Parent not found" error was caused by:

1. **Hardcoded User IDs**: The app was using old/incorrect user IDs that didn't exist in the database

- ✅ Fixed all references in DaycareConnectApp component
- ✅ Updated available parents list with correct IDs

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- ✅ Improved validation in MessageButton component
- ✅ Added authentication checks before starting conversations
