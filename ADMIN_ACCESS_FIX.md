# PERMANENT FIX FOR ADMIN PANEL ACCESS

## The Problem
Your JWT authentication token was created before the RBAC fields were added to the database. The token doesn't know about `isSuperAdmin`, so the API keeps returning the old user data without RBAC fields.

## The Permanent Solution

### Option 1: Clear Cookies (RECOMMENDED - Takes 10 seconds)
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Cookies" in the left sidebar
4. Click "http://localhost:3000"
5. Find the cookie named `auth-token`
6. Right-click it → Delete
7. Refresh the page
8. Log in again with admin@test.com

**This will work permanently** because when you log in again, a NEW JWT token will be created that includes all your RBAC fields from the database.

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new Incognito/Private browsing window
2. Go to localhost:3000
3. Log in with admin@test.com
4. The Admin Panel will appear and stay there

### Why This Happens
- JWT tokens store user info when created
- Your token was made before we added RBAC fields
- Old token → Old user data (no RBAC fields)
- New token → New user data (with RBAC fields)

### After You Fix It
Once you clear the cookie and log in again:
- Admin Panel will ALWAYS appear for you
- It will persist across logouts/logins
- You can switch between Parent/Provider/Admin views freely
- The panel won't disappear anymore

## Verification
After logging in with a fresh token, check the browser console. You should see:
```
=== USER DEBUG INFO ===
isSuperAdmin: true  ← This should be TRUE now
```
