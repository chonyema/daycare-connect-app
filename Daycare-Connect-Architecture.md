# Daycare Connect - Solution Architecture Documentation

## Overview
Daycare Connect is a modern, full-stack web application built with Next.js 14 that connects parents seeking childcare with daycare providers. The platform features unified portals for both user types, real-time capacity management, and automated waitlist functionality.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. User Layer
- **Parents**: Browse daycares, make bookings, manage children's care
- **Providers**: Manage daycare facilities, confirm/reject bookings, view analytics
- **Admins**: System-wide control and management

### 2. Frontend Layer (Next.js 14 + React 18)
- **Parent Portal**: Search functionality, booking interface, account management
- **Provider Portal**: Daycare management, booking approval, analytics dashboard
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, modern component library

### 3. API Layer (Next.js API Routes)
- **Authentication APIs** (`/api/auth/*`): Login, signup, session management
- **Daycare APIs** (`/api/daycares/*`): CRUD operations for facilities
- **Booking APIs** (`/api/bookings/*`): Reservation management with capacity validation
- **Provider APIs** (`/api/provider/*`): Dashboard data, analytics, reports
- **Waitlist APIs** (`/api/waitlist/*`): Queue management system
- **Email APIs** (`/api/emails/*`): Notification system
- **Analytics APIs** (`/api/analytics/*`): Business intelligence and reporting

### 4. Business Logic Layer
- **Capacity Control**: Real-time spot validation and waitlist management
- **Booking Engine**: Status management (PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED/CANCELLED)
- **Email Service**: Automated notifications using Nodemailer
- **Analytics Engine**: Metrics calculation and report generation

### 5. Data Layer (Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL)
- **Users**: Parents, providers, and admin accounts
- **Daycares**: Facility information, capacity, features
- **Bookings**: Reservations with status tracking
- **Reviews**: Parent feedback and ratings
- **Favorites**: Saved daycares for parents

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Unified Portal**: Single application serving both parents and providers
- **Real-time Capacity Management**: Prevents overbooking with live spot tracking
- **Automated Waitlist System**: Seamless queue management when facilities are full
- **Email Notifications**: Automated updates for all booking status changes
- **Advanced Search**: Filter by location, age groups, pricing, availability
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Community-driven quality assessment

### Recent Enhancements
- **Capacity Validation Fix**: Implemented proper spot counting to prevent overbooking
- **Waitlist Automation**: Auto-suggests waitlist when facilities reach capacity
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: React-based framework with App Router
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide React**: Modern icon library

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless API endpoints
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication
- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing and security

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID-compliant relational database
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database client with migrations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database performance

### Communication & Integration
- **Nodemailer**: Email service integration
- **SMTP**: Email delivery protocol
- **RESTful APIs**: Standard HTTP-based communication
- **JSON**: Data interchange format

## Data Flow & Processes

### Booking Process
1. **Discovery**: Parent searches daycares using filters (location, age groups, pricing)
2. **Selection**: Parent views detailed daycare information and available spots
3. **Booking**: Parent submits booking request with child details
4. **Validation**: System validates capacity and creates PENDING booking
5. **Notification**: Provider receives email notification of new booking request
6. **Review**: Provider reviews booking details and makes decision
7. **Confirmation**:
   - If capacity available: Booking confirmed, parent notified
   - If at capacity: Booking rejected with waitlist suggestion
8. **Completion**: Booking lifecycle managed through to completion

### Capacity Management
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live calculation of available spots
- **Validation Logic**: `confirmedBookings >= capacity` prevents overbooking
- **Automatic Waitlist**: Seamless transition when facilities are full
- **Provider Dashboard**: Visual occupancy metrics and trends
- **Analytics**: Demand forecasting and capacity optimization

### Security Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Parent/Provider/Admin)
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and type checking
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted data transmission
- **CORS**: Cross-origin request security

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- **Local Database**: PostgreSQL with Docker support
- **Hot Reload**: Next.js development server
- **Type Checking**: Real-time TypeScript validation
- **Database Migrations**: Prisma migration system

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Caching**: Redis for session management (recommended)
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery optimization
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and analytics

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Entities
- **User**: Multi-role user management (Parent/Provider/Admin)
- **Daycare**: Facility information with capacity and features
- **Booking**: Reservation management with status tracking
- **Review**: Rating and feedback system
- **SavedDaycare**: Parent favorites functionality

### Relationships
- Users → Daycares (Provider ownership)
- Users → Bookings (Parent reservations)
- Daycares → Bookings (Facility bookings)
- Users → Reviews (Parent feedback)
- Users → SavedDaycares (Favorites)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe/PayPal for booking payments
- **Mobile App**: React Native companion application
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for demand prediction
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization framework
- **API Rate Limiting**: Enhanced security and performance
- **Real-time Chat**: Direct parent-provider communication

### Scalability Considerations
- **Microservices**: Break down into smaller, focused services
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for improved performance
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling capabilities
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing and query optimization
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery
